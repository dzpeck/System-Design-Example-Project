# System-Design-Example-Project
An example of the system design process of a manufacturing test system


Just as important as an aptitude in programming is that of designing a system. MY experience is much more robust in system design.
This is an example project that I completed for a systems engineering process class in my final semester of my undergraduate degree. I based the imaginary system I designed on a testing system I saw when I worked at a manufacturing company that make door opening solutions.
This report is almost considered a comprehensive system design document, although some things are missing, Such as:
Verification and validation planning
Risk Mitigation
Deployment planning
Post-Deployment support

If you are here considering my employment:
I do have professional experience in post-deployment support, deployment planning, and risk mit from my time as a system safety engineer. My professional experience also includes code safety review, in accordance with MIL-STD-882E. You will find that I am well suited for working on
complex projects with a great mind for handling high level knowledge, and a growing technical mindset for understanding low levels of systems as well.
